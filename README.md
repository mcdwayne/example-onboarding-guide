## Welcome new team member

This is an overview section welcoming your team member onto the team. This is a place to say some encouraging words of wisdom and give a general overview of what is in the guide

## Start here

This is the 'quick start' section of the doc. As there might end up being a LOT of folders and files in the repo over time, this is a place to cut to the chase and give people the "TL;DR" version of things. It might be good to explain that they would really benefit from reading the whole README though.

### For X you need Y

This section is to give links to essential docs/folders/stats. It is a good idea to think of the 80/20 rule, that 80% of the time you only touch 20% of the capabilities of a system or tool.

Totally made up examples:

1. To clear the cache after loading new table entries, either:
   -  open GUI TOOL and find [CLear Cache] from upper right hand [Operational Menu].
   - from the terminal enter `app servername --clear-cache -u=<username>`

2. Do NOT clear the cache on any production system between the hours of 8:00am and 3:00pm Eastern Time!!!

3. Monthly reporting queries are stored in the /Monthly-Reporting folder. You will need to use `-u=admin1` if running from the CLI.
